Everyone in the crowd was really excited.
People applauded as I stepped across the finish line.
My wonderful dog, Quinn, was right next to me.
The people who organized the race took a picture of us at that moment.
In the picture, Quinn and I both look extremely happy.
It really was a great day.
We were the first blind person and guide dog to finish the Boston 5K.
No one did it before us.
My dog loved running more than anything, so I loved it too.
Quinn even inspired me to run one of the biggest races of all: the Boston Marathon.
I was feeling very sick, so I went to the emergency room.
After several different tests, the doctor gave me the results.
I’ll never forget the look on his face.
He took off his glasses and just said, “Randy…” I knew it was going to be bad news.
He told me that I had a rare neurological disease and I was going to be blind.
I was already losing my vision, and I was only 22.
I was in shock.
I was so young, and my future seemed so dark.
Walking was also becoming difficult.
For a while, I even had to use a wheelchair.
I couldn’t walk, and that was really hard for me.
I thought a guide dog could help me walk and become independent again.
So, I contacted a local organization that offered guide dogs for blind people.
And then I went to New York to get my dog.
That’s when I first met Quinn.
At first, he didn’t notice me at all! He was too interested in his toys.
Then I knew how to connect with Quinn: by playing!.
Quinn and I always played after we went on a walk.
One day, he got a little too excited.
He couldn’t wait to play, so we started walking really fast.
Soon, we started running.
After that, we ran together all the time, and that changed my life.
After we did really well during that 5K, I celebrated with some of my running friends.
Then I went back to the state of New Hampshire.
But my friends stayed in the city to watch the Boston Marathon, which was going to happen the next day.
On the day of the marathon, I watched the news and heard about an explosion at the finish line.
At first, I was in shock.
But then, after that tragic bombing, I knew that I had to run in the Boston Marathon the next year.
I wanted to show that horrible violence couldn’t stop people from enjoying that amazing event.
Quinn and I started running a lot.
But during some of our runs in the fall, I noticed that Quinn seemed tired.
So I took him to the veterinarian, and I got very bad news.
The vet said that Quinn had cancer and he was going to die in a few months.
At that moment, I realized that I wouldn’t just lose my guide dog but also my best friend.
The day we put Quinn to sleep, I held him in my arms, and I told him how much I loved him.
He died while I was hugging him.
I immediately knew that the best way to honor my boy, Quinn, was to run in the Boston Marathon.
It was hard to get out of bed and run in the extremely cold temperatures.
But because I’m blind, I also had to convince my three guides to run in the cold!.
It’s too difficult for a dog to run in a marathon.
A dog will become very tired, so most people run with human guides.
I had a group of three people running next to me, taking turns.
My guides had to tell me where to turn and when to avoid holes in the road.
I also had a running stick, which my guides used to help me go in the right direction.
That was going to be very difficult.
I needed to run one mile in nine minutes for all 26.2 miles of the marathon — without being able to see! 
That’s 30 minutes faster than the average person who isn’t blind!.
The weather was terrible.
There were strong winds, and it was also raining! 
It’s really difficult for a blind person to run while it’s raining.
I knew it was going to be a hard day.
But I tied my shoes and put on a shirt that said “Miles for Quinn.” And then I went to the start line.
I got ready to start the race.
I was next to 30,000 other runners.
I was nervous, and my heart was racing, but when I heard the gun…I just thought of Quinn.
And I ran and ran.
Everything was going well, and I felt strong until we were almost at “Heartbreak Hill.”
Each step was painful.
But then I thought of my boy, Quinn.
I thought about him sitting in my lap.
I remembered hiking with him in New Hampshire and running on the roads by my house.
My memories of Quinn helped me get up that hill.
And when I got to the top, I shouted, “I love you, Quinn boy!” Quinn made me feel strong.
I was able to cross the finish line…in three hours and 50 minutes!.
Autumn is my new dog.
She’s a Labrador like Quinn.
We got her from the same organization that helps blind people.
But Autumn is not a runner like Quinn.
If she sees a squirrel or another animal, she may get distracted.
And that can be dangerous for both of us! I still think about Quinn every day.
I am so happy he inspired me to start running.
